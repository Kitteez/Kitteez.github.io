        <p class="para">Dogs are great animals, in terms of being good friends to us.<br>
        Personally, I own a Min Pin and an American Eskimo. Both dogs are young<br>
        and nice, and are very comforting.

       <h2 class="sub_title">Reasons why dogs are great pets</h2>
       <ul>
        <li>They're cute
        <li>They care about us if we treat them nice
        <li>We are able to play and have fun with them
       </ul>
       <h2 class="sub_title">Dogs and people</h2>
        <p class="para">Just like people, dogs are very social creatures.<br>
        They love attention and being played with, just like we do.<br>
        This is just more reason to have one, as they're great friends!
